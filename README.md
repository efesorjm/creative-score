# Scoring Creative Assets with AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Our project aims to develop an AI tool that scores and provides feedback on creative marketing assets based on strategic and analytical criteria. This helps reduce subjectivity and enhances the effectiveness of the creative review process.


## Background

The problem we aim to solve is the subjective and often frustrating nature of creative reviews in organizations. The review of creative work can lead to subjective feedback, leaving teams unsure of how to move forward. This is a common issue that can hinder productivity and team morale.

Problem 1: Subjective feedback in creative reviews.
Problem 2: Lack of actionable insights for creative teams.
Problem 3: Frustration and inefficiency in the review process.
Our personal motivation comes from witnessing these issues firsthand and wanting to provide a more structured and effective approach. This topic is important as it can significantly improve the creative workflow and outcomes for organizations.


## How is it used?

The solution will be used during the creative review process. Creative teams will upload their work to the AI system, which will analyze and score it based on predefined criteria such as alignment with the brief, creativity, and technical execution.

Users:

Creative teams
Project managers
Clients or any other stakeholders
The AI will provide a report with scores and detailed feedback, helping teams understand strengths and areas for improvement.


## Data sources and AI methods
Our project will rely on data from various sources:

Historical creative reviews and feedback
Creative briefs, brand and project guidelines
Industry standards and best practices
We will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze and score creative work. Training the model will involve supervised learning using labeled data from past reviews.

## Challenges

Our project does not solve the inherent subjectivity in creativity. While it reduces it, personal biases can still influence feedback. Ethical considerations include ensuring the AI does not stifle creativity by overly standardizing the review process.
## What next?

To grow, our project will need:

More diverse data to improve accuracy
Collaboration with industry experts to refine criteria
User feedback to continuously improve the system
Future developments could include integrating more advanced AI techniques and expanding the tool to cover various creative domains.
